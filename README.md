# SimpleKivy
A new way to make Kivy apps using a **PySimpleGUI** approach and with all the power of **Kivy**

# *This project will come back soon with major improvements...*
## Experimental Phase (coming soon)
- **File-chooser/file-save implementation.**
- **Popup implementation.**
- **Modal implementation.**
- **WebView widget based on cefpython3 (extremely experimmental but it finally works!).**
- **Matplotlib integration with more styling options.**
- **IconFonts.**
- **Menus.**
- **Integrated multithreadding and queue management.**
- **Tooltip text property for several widgets.**
- **CVS file view.**
- **Alternative styles and theme management.**


# Installation
##### SimpleKivy has only been tested on **Windows 10** and Python 3.6
### Kivy
You need to install the latest version of `Kivy`. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html).

### Garden widgets
The kivy widget library is always being expanded by the `kivy-garden` widgets. This python library also aims to include the most common ones for more complete and faster development of complex apps.

You need to install these `kivy-garden` widgets:

* context_menu: ```pip install kivy_garden.contextmenu```

### SimpleKivy.py
At the moment, you only need the `SimpleKivy.py` file to use this library. You can either keep it in the same directory as your main code or place it in your `.../Lib` directory . You can download it from this branch.
Other means of installation are not supported at the moment. 

* **This project is in the early stages of development and is expected to change in the future.**

* **Use it at your own risk.**

# Usage

### This Code
[link](example_programs/hello_world.py)

```python
import SimpleKivy as sk

# All the stuff inside your window.
layout = [[sk.Text('Some text on Row 1')],
          [sk.Text('Enter something on Row 2:'), sk.InputText(key='input')],
          [sk.Button('Ok'), sk.Button('Cancel')]]

# Your main program must be inside a function with 3 arguments (app,event,values) and 
# should be added as the event_manager argument of the Window class.
def main(app, event, values):
        # The main program will be called every time the user interacts with
        # the window.    
    print('#',event,'#')

    if event in ['Cancel']:  # close the app if user clicks Cancel
        app.Close()
        # window.Close() # this works too (just comment "app.Close()")
    
    elif event is 'Ok': # detect the 'Ok' button click
    	print('You entered:', values['input'])


# Create the Window
window = sk.Window(layout=layout, event_manager=main,size=(600,200))

# Start the Window
window.Run()
```

### Makes This Window

![hello_world_window](https://github.com/SuperMechaDeathChrist/SimpleKivy/raw/master/images/hello_world_window.PNG)

and returns the value input as well as the button clicked.

# Latest Changes
- Renamed some element classes for consistency.
- New widgets: Watch, ScrollSublayout, ToggleButton, ComboBox.
- More customization options for all widgets.
- Keep-on-top and alpha (transparency) options for the window (only Windows platforms).
- Expanded Text customization (background color).
- Expanded InputText customization (vertical aligment).
- All color options can be entered as keywords (see SimpleKivy.Colors): ```Text('Hello World', background_color='blue')```.
- Default fonts can be entered as keywords (see SimpleKivy.Fonts): ```Text('Hello World', font_name='roboto it')```.
- Default options (Fonts, Colors, ...) are case-insensitive: 'red'=='Red'
- **kvElement: New in-between class that integrates pure kivy widgets into the SimpleKivy architecture. No more waiting for developer implementation to use all the kivy features!!!** ***(Check [this example](example_programs/example_kvelement.py) to learn how to use it)***

# Next In The List
- **TreeView implementation.**
- **Examples and documentation.**

# Supported Elements
This is a list of the supported elements that you can use in your window layouts right now:

***Type**: Class_name = Alias*
* **Text**: T = Text
* **Text markdown renderer**: TMarkup = TextMarkup
  * [Example Markup](example_programs/example_markup_text.py)
* **Buttons**: B = Button
* **Text inputs**: In = InputText
* **ToggleButtons (only one button remains pressed for the same group_id)**: TB = ToggleButton
* **Voids**: Void
* **Multiline text input**: Multiline
* **Combo box (input text and dropdown values)**: DropDown = DD = Combo = ComboBox
* **Spinner**: Spin = Spinner
* **Progress bar**: PB = ProgressBar
* **Image**: Image
* **Box**: Box
* **MenuBar**: MenuBar
  * [Application Menu](example_programs/application_menu_bar.py)
* **Slider**: Slider
* **CheckBox (becomes radio-button when setting a group_id)**: CB = Check = CheckBox
* **Switch on/off**: Switch
* **Video**: Video = VD
* **Video player**: VideoPlayer = VDP
* **Tabbed Panel**: TabGroup = TabPanel
  * [Example Tabbed panel](example_programs/example_tabbed_panel.py)
* **Multiple screens (with transition animations)**: ScreenManager
* **Sublayouts (used as standalone widgets or tab and screen items)**: Col = Column = Subl = Sublayout
* **Scrollable sublayouts (same as sublayouts but with scrollable optinos )**: SCol = SColumn = SSubl = SSublayout = ScrollSublayout
* **Watch. Binds current time to a widget (see SimpleKivy.TimeFormats)**: Watch
  * [Digital Clock](example_programs/digital_clock.py)
* **kvElement (in-between class that integrates pure kivy widgets into the SimpleKivy architecture)**: kvElement
  * [Using the pure kivy FileChooserIconView](example_programs/example_kvelement.py)

Don't use these inside layouts:
* **Window**: Window
* **Layout**: Layout

**Customization (colors/style) of these elements is a work in progress**
